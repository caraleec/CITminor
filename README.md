LABS
Lab 1: Install and setup your personal computer with the software tools required for this course, practice using software tools, practice terminal or shell commands, practice keyboard shortcuts, create your first Node.js server-side JavaScript file
Lab 2: New git repository, initial JavaScript file, add file to git, ignoring files, using diff to see changes, using wildcards, cloning cloud repos locally, branch, repo files.
Lab 3: Practice refactoring JavaScript code to use more modern syntax, destructuring an object and converting normal functions into arrow function expressions. Examine using for..in  syntax with objects. Practice using for..of syntax with arrays, creating a Node.js compatible code module using module.exports and importing a Node.js compatible code module using require. Examine code using the spread operator.
Lab 4: Create initial Fastify Node.js web server, initialize as a Node.js project folder using Node Package Manager (npm). Add Fastify to project using npm, and test using Visual Studio Code (VSCode). Add git repo, exclude node_modules folder from git, make commits, fix MIME error, test, and commit and add a second route with query parameters, test, and commit.
Lab 5: Download and install Postman, create a CIT 281 collection and folders, create a Node.js and fastify server application with GET and respond with JSON, use Postman to test server GET routes, add POST handling to server application and respond with JSON.
Lab 6: Join GitHub and work through Introduction to GitHub course. Create lab file, classes overvie, create and test Book and Library class, add at least two more books to the library and add ISBN and a delete book method.
Lab 7: Create your own GitHub organization for the CIT Minor and first GitHub repository. Clone your GitHub repository to local system.
Lab 8: Create lab file and initialize Node.js folder, install node-fetch package, add fastify starter code, add fastify and node-fetch require statements, fetch JSONPlaceholder data.
Lab 9: Create Learning Lab course/repo within your GitHub account, practice exiting and returning to the course from course repo and work through course.

PROJECTS
Project 1: Use the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create a number of folders, list the folders in a tree-like structure, use the ping command, and practice using the break keyboard sequence. Create and execute a JavaScript files using Node.js and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) terminal and Run and Debug
Project 2: Use the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create and work with a git repository (repo). Refactor the JavaScript program from the previous project to practice using git and practice refactoring. Use git via VSCode, create and use a .gitignore file and diff split screen.
Project 3: Creating a "coinage" code module that is capable of calculating the total value of coin objects. After completing the "coinage" code module functionality,update the "server" code file as a true Node.js web server using the Fastify package. The updated "server" file will display an initial web page with web links to to test the "coinage" code. The initial web page will be loaded from a file.
Project 4: Creating a REST API that works with a "data" source of questions and answers. You will create all of the code to work with the data source using a code module, and test the code module code using provided testing code. You will also create a Node.js REST API to handle the GET verb. 
Project 5: For this project, you will create a Monster Game program using classes. The game will create monsters with initial life values, and minimum life values for the monster to be alive. Once the game is running, each monster's life will be drained by a random amount, and the game will continue until all of the monsters have died. The game will include a delay before each life drain. (Optional Project)
Project 6: You will be creating three classes. The first class is the Shape class that will serve as a base class for the other two classes. The second class is the Rectangle class that will inherit from Shape class. A class that inherits from another class can be called the child class of the base, or parent, class. The third class is the Triangle class that also will inherit from the Shape class.
Project 7: Create an initial CIT Minor portfolio for labs and projects on Github.
